# Components/Tables

Base styles to be shared across all table options
We have 5 table options/modifiers. Usually there will be at least two
options applied to a table since the table class alone is just basic styles.

- Eg. `class="table table--responsive table--striped@medium"`
- `class="table table--stacked table--striped"`

This may feel verbose, but it is the most flexible and efficient way to
handle the use of many different table styles without having to override
each other or use many different cell classes throughout the markup.

Types of tables:

1. Responsive tables with more than two columns that break to a different
   and easier to read format on small screens.
2. Scrollabe tables, for tables with complex content that doesn't
   break down on small screens very easily. Relies on parent container
   to control the overflow
3. Stacked tables, for when there isn't too many columns and they want it
   to behave a little more like a definition list. Uses data
   attributes to add table heading content to table cell pseudo elements
   so we don't lose table headings entirely.
4. Striped tables, we don't want this as a base style on all tables
   otherwise we have to remove them from various breakpoints in various
   situations. Better to lock it down to a class of its own since the
   declaration to style the stripes is quite specific.
5. Product tables. These are specifically used for products to list a
   group of fees. It is only two columns without any heading data
   so much more simplistic.
